# Minister-of-Justice-bot-py
The bot was created for the gameplay in minecraft. The idea is to make cadastral numbers of houses in cities. 
The bot at the moment can create cities, streets, and remember them. 
The mongo database remembers, and I use the mongoengine orm. 

The bot is actively developed
